This repository contains the code to create the high mountain wetland maps presented in the article 'A map of high mountain wetlands in the world's major mountain regions'. A link to the article will be available, once it is published.
The data sets needed to reproduce the mapping approach and to run the code are available under: https://zenodo.org/records/14930773.
